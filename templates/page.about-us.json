I was hanging around my brother’s water-sports distribution business, trying to create a job within his business, with not a lot of luck. Phil (my brother) told me to take some of the raw materials and try and make something new from them ~ basically a project to get me off the floor and out of his office!<br\/><br\/>Taking his advice, I sat for hours, actually days, at my kitchen table, to then eventually come up with a style of ‘shock absorbing’ dog leash. Quite proud of my invention, I made up about 100 of them and went down to the local weekend market and set up a stall to see how they would go…. To my own surprise, they sold out within 2 hours!<br\/><br\/>I went on to sell EzyDog at the markets for 9 years and built an entire network of stallholders throughout Australia and a very backhouse-style factory in my garage. When the Zero Shock Leashes started getting attention in international markets, that’s when the pivotal moment came for the brand and the business. Copycats were on my trail, and so again, through my brother's advice and expertise, we established a strong manufacturing partner in Asia, which enabled us to take EzyDog Worldwide.
