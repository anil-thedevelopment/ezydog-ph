This comprehensive testing process was carried out by an independent group with certification to assess and approve various automotive products, ranging from seat belts and child seats to 4WD bull bars and ambulance stretchers. Their expertise extends to testing products for reputable brands like Holden and KIA, as well as numerous local and international manufacturers. In particular, testing for compliance with both EU and Australian standards was conducted at a minimum speed of 48 kph, aligning with the Australian Standard speed for all similar assessments. Some of the tests even exceeded speeds of 50 kph, highlighting the harness's robust performance in meeting the requirements of International standards.  At the end of each test, all Drive Harnesses were still functional and showed no failures in material.

However, there are distinct differences between the two styles. The DFD Boost boasts an updated, more ergonomic design with slightly thinner foam, offering greater freedom of movement, which makes it an excellent choice for active dogs. On the other hand, if your dog is a stockier breed, has an injury or impairment or on the slower side, we recommend the Standard DFD for added support and stability. Regardless of your choice, both styles are crafted using the highest quality materials, prioritising your dog's safety and comfort above all else.<\/p>"}},"9230c84d-899d-492d-bc5f-b444b02ef2b6":{"type":"question","settings":{"question":"What is the main difference between all the Harnesses?","answer":"<p>EzyDog offers a variety of harnesses to cater to different needs and preferences. The main differences lie in design, purpose, and features. For example, the Convert Harness is known for its versatility and strength for larger breeds, the Chest Plate Harness provides ergonomic support and the broadest range of adjustment for growing pups, and the Quick Fit Harness is lightweight and designed for easy, one-click use. The Express Harness is a more durable design and can be customised. Our X-Link Harness includes a front and rear D-Ring, allowing for front or dual attachment points. Explore our range to find the harness that best suits your dog's unique requirements. Keep an eye out for the icons in the product descriptions or shop by the size of your dog for our recommendations.<\/p>"}},"480f662c-0ac1-4bd2-9b63-152d7fcce864":{"type":"question","settings":{"question":"Do you use Stainless Steel on all your products?","answer":"<p>We use a range of materials on the products. We prioritise durability and safety in our products. Stainless Steel is a material known for its strength and resistance to rust and corrosion, and we use this on some key components we think require this type of metal. We use a variety of other corrosion-resistant materials or coatings to make our products last, chosen based on their compatibility with other materials used in the product construction.<\/p>"}},"9763da1a-8952-46b1-bd9c-877657f5d154":{"type":"question","settings":{"question":"How do I measure my dog for the right Harness size?","answer":"<p>Measuring your dog for a harness is essential to ensure a comfortable fit. Typically, you'll need to measure your dog's girth (around the widest part of the chest) and sometimes their neck circumference. Check the specific product page for detailed sizing guidelines to find the perfect fit for your dog.
